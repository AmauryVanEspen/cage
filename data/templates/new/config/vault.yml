#     $OVERRIDE   The name of the current override
#     $POD        The name of the pod
#     $CONTAINER  The name of the container

# How should individual containers authenticate themselves to vault?  The only

#
# token:
#
#   To use this, set the environment variables `VAULT_ADDR` and
#   `VAULT_MASTER_TOKEN` before running conductor.  These values will be
#   used to construct per-container `VAULT_TOKEN` values, which be added
#   to the appropriate containers along with `VAULT_ADDR`.
